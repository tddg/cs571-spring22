    <h1 style=font-size:57px>CS 571: Operating Systems</h1>
    <!--img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/leaplab.jpg" style="display:inline;width: 35px"/-->

	Welcome to the graduate course on Operating Systems. This course
covers the concepts and design principles of modern operating
systems, both from theory and practical aspects, spanning the
following aspects: virtualization, concurrency, persistence,
distributed systems, and virtual machines/containers. The purpose of
this course is to teach OS designs from a research point of view.

	<strong>Note</strong> that this semester I make substantial
changes to CS 571 with a strong focus on the research aspects of OS
and computer systems in general; CS 571 may not sub CS 471 any more
if you are an undergraduate who has not taken the mandatary CS 471 in
CS@GMU. If you need to take CS 471, I highly suggest you enroll CS
471 instead.
