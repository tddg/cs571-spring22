## Prerequisite

* Grade of C or better in *CS 310, CS 367, and CS 465*. 
* All students **MUST** be comfortable with programming in the C language. This is a strong requirement. 
* Take this [Quiz](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NRL5eLQ-KqhZ6f1PSk-vAbaE9y7FKVnD-aXTCUfBlH8/edit?usp=sharing), if you are a graduate student who did your undergradaute study elsewhere and you are not sure if you meet the prerequisites.


## Reading

There are no official textbooks. Required readings are (most
frequently) in the form of seminal [research papers](./reading_list.html) and/or selected
textbook chapters of the awesome OSTEP textbook. 

If you need a textbook to review and catch background, go get **OSTEP**,
which is an excellent resource for learning OS and is completely
free. OSTEP is **publicly available** at: 

* [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Aug, 2018 (v 1.00)

I also strongly encourage you to discuss the papers with other
students in the class â€” you may have insights that others do not, and
vice versa. Oftentimes, students form reading groups, which I
encourage; on the other hand, I would like to point out that group
discussion is **not an effective substitute for actually reading the
paper**.



## Class participation

In addition to textbook concepts that I will cover in the form of
lectures, for research papers, we will use a discuss-oriented format.
Therefore, class participation is required. We will discuss the
papers and articles that we will have all read before each class. I
will provide you with a review form that you must complete and submit
before the class. I will provide feedback to your paper reviews the
night before the class. During the class, I will lead discussions by
asking questions of students at random in class. Note that your
performance in class form up to 15% of your overall grade, so it does
matter that you 1) show up to class **AND** 2) participate in the
discussion (which in fact requires you to read the papers). 



## Research projects

Provided in class



## GitLab rules

Refer to [GitLab Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/gitlab_setup.html) for
detailed instructions on setting up GitLab repos.




## Grading policy

Your grade will be calculated as follows:

* 15% class participation
* 15% paper reviews
* 10% project proposal
* 10% project checkpoint report 1
* 10% project checkpoint report 2
* 40% final project report, presentation, artifact eval

## Grading rules

The final grade is computed according to the following rules:

* A+: >= 97%; A: \[92%, 97%); A-: \[87%, 92%)
* B+: \[82%, 87%); B: \[77%, 82%); B-: \[72%, 77%)
* C+: \[66%, 72%); C: \[63%, 66%); C-: \[60%, 63%)
* D+: \[50%, 60%)
* F: < 50%
